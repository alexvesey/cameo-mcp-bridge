# Plan: Physical Architecture Competency + Codex Plugin Execution

**Generated**: 2026-04-20
**Estimated Complexity**: High

## Overview
Make `cameo-mcp-bridge` operationally capable of:

- creating and validating the full physical-architecture artifact family end to end
- reproducing the relevant engineer workflows from the external reference corpus without baking source-specific naming into the product
- proving correctness with live Cameo validation instead of static claims
- staying token-efficient inside the Codex app through compact reads, review packets, and plugin-local guidance
- shipping as a repo-local Codex plugin that can start the MCP server and steer agents into verification-first behavior

This plan supersedes the narrower physical-architecture-only scope. It treats capability coverage, live verifiability, token compression, and Codex productization as one backlog.

## Current Baseline
- Live bridge probing is established: health, capabilities, and open-project checks are already part of the working loop.
- Native matrix support is live for `derive`, `satisfy`, and `allocation`.
- `Refine Requirement Matrix` still needs live repair so matrix coverage is not yet uniformly healthy.
- The repo already has reusable verification, semantic validation, methodology helpers, and a repo-local Codex plugin scaffold.

## Mandatory Outcomes
- A live Cameo run can create or validate the physical-architecture artifact set expected by the reference corpus.
- The same system can follow the reference workflow shapes, not just approximate their outputs.
- Every readiness claim is backed by machine-readable receipts, targeted live probes, or exported evidence.
- Codex app usage stays compact by default: probe first, read narrowly, escalate to heavy payloads only when needed.
- The workspace exposes a first-class Codex plugin with local MCP startup and a thin skill layer.

## Prerequisites
- CATIA Magic / Cameo Systems Modeler 2024x with the repo plugin deployed
- Java 17 available for plugin rebuild/deploy
- Python environment for `mcp-server`
- A live Cameo project open during validation
- The external reference corpus remains available outside the repo as the competency contract

## Sprint 1: Productize Codex Entry Points
**Goal**: Turn the repo into a usable Codex plugin and encode compact, verification-first usage patterns.
**Demo/Validation**:
- Codex can see the plugin in the workspace marketplace
- The plugin starts the local MCP server successfully
- A Codex session can run `cameo_probe_bridge`, `cameo_status`, and `cameo_get_project` through the plugin path

### Task 1.1: Finalize Repo-Local Plugin Manifest
- **Location**: `plugins/cameo-mcp-bridge/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
- **Description**: Replace scaffold placeholders with the real repo metadata, Codex-facing descriptions, and marketplace entry.
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Manifest uses the real plugin name and current version line
  - Marketplace entry resolves to `./plugins/cameo-mcp-bridge`
  - No dead `hooks` or `apps` placeholders remain
- **Validation**:
  - Open manifests and confirm paths and metadata are internally consistent

### Task 1.2: Add a Local MCP Launcher
- **Location**: `plugins/cameo-mcp-bridge/.mcp.json`, `plugins/cameo-mcp-bridge/scripts/run-cameo-mcp-server.ps1`
- **Description**: Start `cameo_mcp.server` from the repo with a predictable local launcher that prefers the repo venv and fails loudly if the install is broken.
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - `.mcp.json` points to the launcher
  - The launcher resolves the repo root and `mcp-server` relative to itself
  - Missing venv/package state produces a clear failure message
- **Validation**:
  - Run the launcher directly in PowerShell
  - Verify the process starts `cameo_mcp.server`

### Task 1.3: Add a Token-Efficient Live Validation Skill
- **Location**: `plugins/cameo-mcp-bridge/skills/cameo-live-validation/`
- **Description**: Add one thin skill that encodes probe-first, compact-read, verification-first operating behavior for Codex sessions.
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.2
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Skill tells agents to separate bridge health from open-project readiness
  - Skill biases toward compact views, filtered reads, and verification tools before heavy payloads
  - Skill points at the existing live scripts only for true smoke/regression work
- **Validation**:
  - Review the skill text and ensure it matches the repo’s actual tools and scripts

### Task 1.4: Smoke the Plugin End-to-End in Codex
- **Location**: Codex app, live workspace
- **Description**: Confirm the plugin installs cleanly, starts the MCP server, and exposes the expected bridge behavior in-app.
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 1.1-1.3
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Plugin appears in the workspace marketplace
  - MCP startup succeeds from the plugin launcher
  - Probe/status/project checks work from the plugin path
- **Validation**:
  - Live Codex plugin smoke in this workspace

- **Description**: Keep matrix assertions split by kind so working paths stay green while the `Refine Requirement Matrix` path is repaired and revalidated.
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Live matrix validation reports per-kind pass/fail instead of one collapsed result
  - `derive`, `satisfy`, and `allocation` remain live-positive
  - `refine` returns the expected populated cells in a live run
- **Validation**:
  - Live run of `live_validate_matrices.py` against the ATM model

### Task 2.4: Add Package-Structure Validation
- **Location**: `mcp-server/cameo_mcp/methodology_workflows.py`, `verification.py`

- **Description**: Cut the next release line only after live regression and Codex plugin smoke pass together.
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 5.1-5.2
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Release notes match the actual live-validated behavior
  - No feature is called complete without a matching live or unit validation path
- **Validation**:
  - Final pre-release checklist and live rerun

## Parallel Workstreams
- **Workstream A: Codex productization**
  - Owns plugin packaging, launcher, marketplace metadata, and compact skill guidance
- **Workstream B: Java bridge semantics**
  - Owns typed part/port support, connector/item-flow readback, and deploy/restart validation
- **Workstream C: Python methodology and verification**
  - Owns physical methodology packs, validators, review packets, and package gates
- **Workstream D: Live regression**
  - Owns reference-workflow mapping, capability inventories, end-to-end runners, and evidence bundles

## Dependency Summary
- Sprint 1 can run immediately and in parallel with the mapping work.
- Sprint 2 depends on the external corpus and current repo readback, not on new Java code.
- Sprint 3 depends on Sprint 2 because the workflow contract needs to define the semantic readback gaps precisely.
- Sprint 4 depends on Sprint 3 because physical validators and guidance need the richer bridge payloads.
- Sprint 5 depends on Sprint 4 because end-to-end proof requires both capabilities and validation receipts.

## Testing Strategy
- Keep fast unit tests around matrix-kind parsing, payload validation, launcher behavior, and semantic-check logic.
- Add live validation for artifact families that depend on actual Cameo behavior: physical activity partitions, full ports, item flows, allocation matrices, satisfy matrices, derive matrices, and state-machine triggers.
- Treat the external reference corpus as a private competency contract rather than a product-surface naming source.

## Potential Risks and Gotchas
- Typed port and flow-property semantics may still expose Cameo API edge cases that need native Java handling instead of macro fallback.
- Live deploys are not trustworthy until the plugin is rebuilt, redeployed, and Cameo is fully restarted.
- Workflow parity can fail even when artifact coverage looks good if package structure, row/column direction, or conjugation semantics are wrong.
- Codex plugin packaging is low risk, but it will be noisy if the launcher does not fail clearly on missing local setup.

## Rollback Plan
- Keep plugin packaging isolated under `plugins/` and `.agents/plugins/` so it can be removed without touching the Java bridge.
- Land bridge and Python capability work in small slices that can be reverted independently.
- Treat live smoke scripts as non-destructive by default; scratch-creation tests must clean up created artifacts before completion.
